## About the Project

This project contains all notebooks, code and analysis I've done during the [Azure Databricks & Spark For Data Engineers Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-databricks-spark-core-for-data-engineers/) on Udemy.
*To everyone reading this*, I highly recommend taking this course, because it provides an extensive view on Azure, Databricks, PySpark, SQL and Data Analysis in general. It's also great to use as a refresher before Azure or Databricks Certifications.
Moreover, the project revolves around Formula 1, which is one of my favourite sports (Go Max!).

Notable Topics:
* Azure Databricks Clusters, Cluster Pools and Policies
* Storage Accounts and Authentication
* Azure Data Lake Storage - Access Patterns, Secrets, Mounting to Databricks
* PySpark - Spark Architecture, Data Ingestion, Transformations (Filters, Joins), Aggregations (GroupBy, Window Functions)
* Spark SQL - Temporary Views, Databases, Tables, SQL flavour of all PySpark features
* Incremental Loads
* Delta Lake - Architecture, History, Time Travel, Vacuum, Merge/Upsert
* Azure Data Factory - Debugging Pipelines, Linked Services, Triggers
